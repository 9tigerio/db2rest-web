# Run on Droplet

Droplets are linux based virtual machines provided by DigitalOcean. Follow the instructions
[here](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/getting-started/quickstart) to launch an Ubuntu based droplet.

The droplet should be created in the same DigitalOcean region in which the database has been created.
