# Insert Multiple Rows

DB2Rest supports adding multiple rows in a table per request. This is useful in the following scenarios:

    1. Data migration / Batch processing - Insert large data-set in chunks of 'n' records. Ex - file processing.
    2. Front end multi row inserts - application can create records of same type - Order containing Line items.


## Build your site

Build your site **for production**:

```bash
npm run build
```

The static files are generated in the `build` folder.

## Deploy your site

Test your production build locally:

```bash
npm run serve
```

The `build` folder is now served at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

You can now deploy the `build` folder **almost anywhere** easily, **for free** or very small cost (read the **[Deployment Guide](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment)**).
