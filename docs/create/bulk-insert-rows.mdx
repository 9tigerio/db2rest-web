# Bulk Insert Rows

Bulk insert of rows works like single row insert. The difference is bulk insert works with multiple records.
The payload can be a JSON array of objects or lines in CSV format. Irrespective of the data type, the
number of keys in the JSON object or CSV rows must be same.

With bulk insert, several rows can be inserted in a single network request. DB2Rest further optimizes the record insertion.
All the rows are batched and send to database as a single INSERT statement.

:::tip Bulk Insert Scenarios / Use-Cases

     - Data migration / Batch processing - Insert large data-set in chunks of `n` records. Ex - file processing.
     - Front end multi row inserts - application can create records of same type - Order containing Line items.

:::


:::warning

The batch size is currently not configurable. This will be available in a future release. Hence, it is recommended
to send `10-15` rows at a time for efficient processing.

## Example Request

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="cURL" label="cURL" default>
        ```bash

        curl --request POST \
        --url http://localhost:8080/actor/bulk \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
        --data '[
            {

                "first_name" : "Shahrukh",
                "last_name" : "Khan"
            },
            {

                "first_name" : "Hrithik",
                "last_name" : "Roshan"
            }
        ]

        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="httpie" label="HTTPie">
        ```bash

        echo '[
            {

                "first_name" : "Shahrukh",
                "last_name" : "Khan"
            },
            {

                "first_name" : "Hrithik",
                "last_name" : "Roshan"
            }
        ]
        ' |  \
        http POST http://localhost:8080/actor/bulk \
        Content-Type:application/json

        ```
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>


:::tip Default Value Handling

If the column has a default value, and the key is not supplied in the JSON, then database will set the default value.
However, if the column (with default value) is not nullable and the key is supplied with `null` value, entire insert operation will fail.

## HTTP Response

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="pg" label="PostgreSQL" default>
        ```http


        HTTP/1.1 201
        Content-Type: application/json
        Transfer-Encoding: chunked
        {
            "rows": [1,1],
            "keys": [
                    {
                        "actor_id": 205
                    },
                    {
                        "actor_id": 206
                    }
            ]
        }

        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="mysql" label="MySQL">
        ```http
        HTTP/1.1 201
        Content-Type: application/json
        Transfer-Encoding: chunked

        {
            "rows": [1,1],
            "keys": [
                {
                    "GENERATED_KEY": 202
                },
                {
                    "GENERATED_KEY": 203
                }
            ]
        }



        ```
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>


On successful creation of the rows in the table, DB2Rest responds with HTTP code 201. The response payload has an
attribute `rows`. It is an array containing the numbers of rows affected by each insert statement in the batch.
The response payload also returns the keys generated for each new row saved in the database.


## Error handling

The following request payload will result in an error as the column `city` is not part of the `actor` table.

    ```json
    [
        {

            "first_name" : "Shahid",
            "last_name" : "Kapoor",
            "city" : "Mumbai"
        },

        {

            "first_name" : "Kartik",
            "last_name" : "Aryan",
            "city" : "Mumbai"
        }
    ]
    ```

:::info

DB2Rest has built-in support for various API and database access best-practices. In order to report API errors consistently,
it implements
[RFC 7807 - Problem Details for HTTP APIs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807).

:::

### Error Response

This will result in error response with HTTP status code 404 as shown in the listing below.

```json
{
	"type": "https://db2rest.com/error/missing-column",
	"title": "Missing Column Error",
	"status": 404,
	"detail": "Missing column actor.city",
	"instance": "/actor/bulk",
	"errorCategory": "Missing-Column",
	"timestamp": "2024-02-20T10:48:22.777339Z"
}
```

In this case none of the two records will be saved in the database.

## Transaction Management

In the error scenario above, the second record has error. However, DB2Rest will reject both records and nothing
gets saved in the database. This is because DB2Rest handles [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) transaction properties.
This ensures either the entire batch is saved or nothing is saved.

:::info

DB2Rest co-ordinates transaction management with the database. It is applicable for both single and multiple records.
In both cases DB2Rest ensures data is rolled back in case of an error.
