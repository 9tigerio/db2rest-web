# Run DB2Rest as Koyeb Web Service


![Run on Koyeb](./assets/run-on-koyeb.png "Run on Koyeb")


# What is a Koyeb Service ?

Koyeb service is an application that can run as a web application, API accessible publicly over internet or private like a background worker.
Services can part of a microservices application or a single monolithic application.
The platform makes it easy to deploy such service from Git repositories or using a Docker image. For more information on Koyeb service refer
to this [link.](https://www.koyeb.com/docs/reference/services)

:::tip

It is very easy to auto-scale a service on Koyeb. Reference is below:

[Koyeb Autocaling reference](https://www.koyeb.com/docs/run-and-scale/autoscaling)

:::


## Create Koyeb App

In order to create Koyeb App, click on the `Apps` tab.

![Koyeb Apps](./assets/koyeb_apps.png "Koyeb Apps")


On the `Apps` dashboard click on `Create App` button.

![Create App](./assets/create_app.png "Create App")

This will show the `Deploy a new project on Koyeb` page.

## Deploy a new project

On the `Deploy a project on Koyeb` page there are options to:

- Github : deploy from a Github repository.
- Docker : deploy from a Docker image.

![Deploy a new project](./assets/deploy_new_project_on_koyeb.png "Deploy a new project")

### Select Deployment method

DB2Rest provides a [public docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kdhrubo/db2rest). This can be used to deploy as Koyeb service. Hence, select `Docker` as the deployment method.


### Docker Image

Now on the `Docker image`, page provide path to the DB2Rest docker image and click on `Next`.

:::info[DB2Rest Public Docker Image]

docker.io/kdhrubo/db2rest:latest

:::


![DB2Rest Docker image](./assets/db2rest_docker_image.png "DB2Rest Docker image")

This will show the `Configure service and deploy` screen. On this screen some configuration needs to be edited as described in the next sections.

![Configure service and deploy](./assets/configure_service_deployment.png "Configure service and deploy")


### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:

- DB_URL
- DB_USER
- DB_PASSWORD

These values are available from the connection details tab (Java tab) as shown below.

![Environment Variables](./assets/env_variables.png "Environment Variables")

The environment variables can be configured as shown below. All the values are set as type `Plaintext`.

![Configured Environment Variables](./assets/configured_environment_variables.png "Configured Environment Variables")

### Regions

In this case the service is going to be deployed in the `Frankfurt` region. The [DB2Rest](https://db2rest.com) service should be deployed
in the same region as the database.


### Instance

In this example a free instance is selected for demonstration. Expand this section and select compute, memory and disk capacity appropriate for
your deployment.

### Scaling

Change the number of instances to suit your application needs.

:::warning

As of writing this article, Koyeb does not support scale to zero.

:::


### Exposed Ports

In this case the port `8080` is selected (instead of default `8000`). However, multiple ports can be selected (including remote debugging port) for the application service.

![Exposed Ports](./assets/exposed_ports.png "Exposed Ports")

### Health checks

The health check configuration should be changed to point to the DB2Rest actuator end point for health status check as shown below.

![Health checks](./assets/health_check.png "Health checks")

### App and Service names

The app and service names can be changed, however in this case default values are applied.


Finally click on the `Deploy` button on the top of the section.

### Deployment Status

On successful deployment, healthy instance shows up.

![Deployment Status](./assets/deployment_success.png "Deployment Status")


### Logs & Events

The deployment logs can be reviewed to verify successful deployment.

![Logs & Events](./assets/logs_events.png "Logs & Events")

Key things to note in the log are:

- All health checks are passing and instance is ready to process requests.
- DB2Rest is successfully started and actuator is available.
- DB2Rest is connected to the database and has successfully loaded the meta-data about the `employee` table created in the
[Create Database on Koyeb](https://db2rest.com/docs/koyeb/create-database-on-koyeb) guide.
