# What is a Koyeb Service ?

Koyeb service is an application that can run as a web application, API accessible publicly over internet or private like a background worker.
Services can part of a microservices application or a single monolithic application.
The platform makes it easy to deploy such service from Git repositories or using a Docker image. For more information on Koyeb service refer
to this [link.](https://www.koyeb.com/docs/reference/services)

### Select Deployment method

DB2Rest provides a [public docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kdhrubo/db2rest). This can be used to deploy as Koyeb service. Hence, select `Docker` as the deployment method.


### Docker Image

Now on the `Docker image`, page provide path to the DB2Rest docker image and click on `Next`.
