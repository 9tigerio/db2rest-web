## How can I handle same table/view names but in different databases?

The DB2Rest database user account has access to multiple databases and these databases have tables or views that have same names.

For example in a MySQL server 2 databases.

    - `DB1`
    - `DB2`

Both these databases have a table named `users`.

So the schema looks like this
    - `DB1.users`
    - `DB2.users`


In this case there is name collision i.e if no database/schema/catalog is not specified then the operation will fail.
This can be resolved by specifying the schema/catalog as a header parameter.

    - For `GET` use header `Accept-Profile` to specify schema.

Then two different tables can be queried.

```
GET /users HTTP/1.1
Accept-Profile: DB1
```

```
GET /users HTTP/1.1
Accept-Profile: DB2
```
    - For `POST` use header `Content-Profile` to specify schema.

:::tip

In case of a join, specify the schema of the root table using `Accept-Profile`, where as schema for the other tables
can be specified directly as `schemaName` attribute.
