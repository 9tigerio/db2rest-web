# Autogenerate Primary Key with TSID

:::info

Feature is only applicable for relational databases. It is not available for MongoDB.

:::


DB2Rest supports a way to automatically create chronological sequences of the written data out of the box. It is made possible
by generating Time-Sorted Unique Identifiers (TSID) for primary key columns during insert operation.
This does not require any native database support.


## Benefits of TSIDs

DB2Rest has a built-in ability to automatically create Time-Sorted Unique Identifiers (TSID) that offer benefits such as the following:

    - Chronologically sorted like integers.
    - Compact storage (14 bytes).
    - Efficient indexing due to sequential nature.

TSIDs combine the benefits of integers, UUIDs, and ULIDs and are a recommended alternative for primary key values.
They borrow some structure from [Snowflake ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake_ID)s and Instagram IDs.
One of the additional benefits are that we get automatic date timestamping that we can use for things like sorting and data analysis later on.
This can save us from adding an additional `Date` column in our schema for our database tables.
We get a timestamp, a node (shard) id, and a sequence number, all in one! TSIDs come in handy when writing data about temporal entities or
anything that is event-based, like comments, posts, transactions, etc. But they can also be used as a primary key for non-temporal data in your tables.
This also makes data migration much easier.


## Structure of TSIDs

42-bit timestamp: Calculated using milliseconds from a reference date (e.g., 2020-01-01).

10-bit machine ID: Unique identifier for the machine generating the TSID.

12-bit sequence number: Ensures uniqueness within the same millisecond.


:::note

When stored as a Long, TSIDs look like this:

38352658567418872

And when written as Text or a String they look like this:

01226N0640J7Q

## Auto Generating TSIDs

DB2Rest can automatically generate TSID primary keys as it inserts data through its instant API into the database tables.
It does this by auto detecting an existing primary key column in the table you are writing to and will use the datatype category (Integer-based or Text/String based)
to generate the appropriate TSID format (Long/Number or Text).


Let's use a DB2Rest API endpoint to write to our `department` table and let DB2Rest worry about automatically creating our tables' primary keys for the row inserted.


**PostgreSQL**

```sql
CREATE TABLE department (
	id varchar NOT NULL,
	"name" varchar NOT NULL
);
```
