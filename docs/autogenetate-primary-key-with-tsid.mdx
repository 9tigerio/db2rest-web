# Autogenerate Primary Key with TSID


DB2Rest supports a way to automatically create chronological sequences of the written data out of the box. It is made possible
by generating Time-Sorted Unique Identifiers (TSID) for primary key columns during insert operation.
This does not require any native database support.


## Benefits of TSIDs

DB2Rest has a built-in ability to automatically create Time-Sorted Unique Identifiers (TSID) that offer benefits such as the following:

    - Chronologically sorted like integers.
    - Compact storage (14 bytes).
    - Efficient indexing due to sequential nature.

TSIDs combine the benefits of integers, UUIDs, and ULIDs and are a recommended alternative for primary key values.
They borrow some structure from [Snowflake ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake_ID)s and Instagram IDs.
One of the additional benefits are that we get automatic date timestamping that we can use for things like sorting and data analysis later on.
This can save us from adding an additional Date column in our schema for our database tables.
We get a timestamp, a node (shard) id, and a sequence number, all in one! TSIDs come in handy when writing data about temporal entities or
anything that is event-based, like comments, posts, transactions, etc. But they can also be used as a primary key for non-temporal data in your tables.
This also makes data migration much easier.
