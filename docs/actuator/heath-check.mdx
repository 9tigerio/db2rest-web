# Health Check


The `/health` endpoint is used to check the health or state of the running application.
Itâ€™s usually exercised by monitoring software to alert us if the running instance goes down or gets unhealthy for other reasons, e.g.,
connectivity issues with our DB, lack of disk space, etc.


The actuator health check endpoint can be used to test the installation. Once DB2Rest has been [installed](../intro), the following `GET` requests
will inform the status of the server.


import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="cURL" label="cURL" default>
        ```bash

        curl --request GET \
        --url http://[IP_ADDRESS]:8080/actuator/health \
        --header 'User-Agent: insomnia/8.6.1'


        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="httpie" label="HTTPie">
        ```bash

        http GET http://[IP_ADDRESS]:8080/actuator/health \
        User-Agent:insomnia/8.6.1

        ```
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>


The actuator health check service in DB2Rest will return the following response:


```http
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

{
	"status": "UP"
}

```
The `status` value of `UP` confirms that the service is up and running.
