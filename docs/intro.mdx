# Getting Started with DB2Rest

Let's discover **DB2Rest in less than 10 minutes** by running the Jar distribution.


## Run On Premise / On Virtual Machines (VM)

In order to deploy DB2Rest on a laptop/PC/Mac, bare metal box or a VM on any cloud like [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2/)
or [DigitalOcean Droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets), follow the steps below:

### Pre-requisite

    - PostgreSQL or MySQL is installed and running.

### Minimum System Requirements for DB2REST

    - Java 21
    - 2-4 GB RAM/Memory.

DB2Rest needs Java Runtime 21+ to run. This is because it is compiled with Java 21 and makes uses of Java Virtual Thread feature
for high scalability. With [virtual thread](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/core/virtual-threads.html) DB2REST
can handle very high volume of requests even on a single machine.


### Install JDK 21+

Download JDK 21 or above. There are many flavors of JDK available from different vendors like Oracle, AWS, OpenJDK. 

Open JDK can be downloaded from here - https://jdk.java.net/21/.
This article from https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/How-to-install-Java-21
provides a step by step guide to install OpenJDK 21 on Windows platform.
For other operating system refer to this article https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-openjdk-free-java-multi-os-guide/ for guidance.

Oracle JDK 21 can be downloaded and installed for various operating systems by following the instructions [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/install/overview-jdk-installation.html)

### Download DB2Rest

Now that you have successfully downloaded, installed and verified Java 21, the next step is to get DB2Rest.
DB2Rest is shipped as a single executable Java Archive or jar file So it's super easy to get up and running under a minute.

The latest version of DB2Rest - **{siteConfig.customFields.version}** can be downloaded from the link below:

:::info[Download Link]

**{siteConfig.customFields.download_url}**

:::

:::warning[Download Link for Legacy Oracle 9i]

**{siteConfig.customFields.download_url_oracle_9i}**

:::

### Run DB2Rest.

Open terminal and execute the command below:

```Shell


$ java -DDB_URL=[DB_URL] -DDB_USER=[DB_USER] -DDB_PASSWORD=[DB_PASSWORD] -jar ${siteConfig.customFields.download_url}


``` 

<pre><code>{`Hello ${siteConfig.customFields.download_url}`}</code></pre>

Replace the values for the following parameters:

| Sl# | Parameter Name | Description                | Example                                                                                                                            |
|-----|----------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.  | DB_URL         | JDBC URL connection string | - MySQL : jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/sakila     <br/> - PostgreSQL : jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/sakila?currentSchema=public |
| 2.  | User           | Database user              |                                                                                                                                    |
| 3.  | Password       | Database password          |                                                                                                                                    |       


Once this command is executed, within a few seconds, DB2Rest is ready to service your data access requests.  

### Verify DB2Rest Installation

The actuator endpoint can be used to test the installation.



import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="cURL" label="cURL" default>
        ```bash

        curl --request GET \
        --url http://[IP_ADDRESS]:8080/actuator/health \
        --header 'User-Agent: insomnia/8.6.1'


        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="httpie" label="HTTPie">
        ```bash

        http GET http://[IP_ADDRESS]:8080/actuator/health \
        User-Agent:insomnia/8.6.1

        ```
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>


The actuator health check service in DB2Rest will return the following response:


```http
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

{
	"status": "UP"
}

```
