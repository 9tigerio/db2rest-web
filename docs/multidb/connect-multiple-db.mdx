# Connect Multiple Databases

One of the super features of DB2Rest is that one single instance can work with multiple separate databases. For example
a DB2Rest node can connect to a MySQL and PostgreSQL database.


## Use Environment Variables

The first method to connect DB2Rest with multiple databases is similar to running with one database as described in the [getting started](../intro) section.
The multiple database configuration can be set as environment variables.
