# Why you need DB2Rest?

Writing software today is not an easy task. You have to deal with requirements, backlog management, processes,
engineering, framework selection, tests, automation, security, cloud, CI/CD tooling. There are just too many things to consider. Now in the engineering phase you have to tackle with complex UI and interactions, developing complex business logic, many integrations and last but not the least
persist and query data. 

Most projects spend 30% of the time writing boilerplate data access logic. There 
is constant struggle with dealing with the complexity and runtime overhead of Object Relational Mapping(ORM) frameworks, implementing best practices for performance, transaction management. This makes evolving and developing data access layer most challenging part of application development. A badly developed data access layer can bring the entire application down resulting in huge business and customer
loss. 


:::tip

 **Never** write data access code again. Get **`DB2Rest`** instead.

:::


DB2Rest is a cloud-native, fully configurable, secure no-code data access middleware layer.
It provides an ultra-fast REST API layer over databases in seconds. Developers never write boilerplate data access logic,
neither have to worry about overheads of ORM or think about best practices. These are all taken care out of the box by DB2Rest.
What more - you do not even need to know SQL - instead knowing a much simpler REST Query Language (RQL) is good enough to 
integrate and interact with DB2Rest from business logic or front-end layer of your application.
