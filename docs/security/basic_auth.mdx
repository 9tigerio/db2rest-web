# Basic Auth


DBRest supports basic auth to protect the API end points. By default, auth is disabled in DB2Rest. It can be enabled by setting the
`ENABLE_AUTH` environment variable to `true`.

:::info

If the parameter - `ENABLE_AUTH` is set to `true`, then authentication is enabled.

:::


## Auth Data Source

The security data source is kept separate from application properties. Currently only file based datasource is supported.
The absolute path of the data file can be specified with the `AUTH_DATA_SOURCE` configuration parameter.
An example to set auth data source is shown below:

```
$ export AUTH_DATA_SOURCE = `file://${user.home}/git/db2rest/auth/auth-sample.yml`
```


:::tip

The auth data source parameter must be prefixed with `file://` if the authentication data is sourced from a file.
In case the data is loaded from a remote location prefix it with `http` or `https`.

:::


## Auth Data Components

### Name

The first attribute in the auth data file is the `name`. It is the name of the data file or project.

### Resource Roles

In this section specify the protected resources or URI paths, HTTP method and the roles which are allowed to access this URI.

### Excluded Resources

In this section specify the resources which are not protected by DB2Rest security with the URI Paths and the HTTP method.

### Users

In this section specify the basic auth user-name, password and roles associated with a system or user accessing the database resources.


## Sample Data File

A sample auth data file is shown below:

```

name: db2rest-security

resourceRoles:
  - resource: "/v1/rdbms/pgdb/actor/**"
    method: post
    roles:
      - role2
      - role3
      - role4
  - resource: "/api/v2/host"
    method: get
    roles:
      - role2
      - role3
      - role4


excludedResources:
  - resource: "/v1/rdbms/**"
    method: get
  - resource: "/v1/rdbms/pgdb/factor"
    method: post
  - resource: "/v1/rdbms/**"
    method: put
  - resource: "/v1/rdbms/**"
    method: delete

users:
  - username: admin
    password: admin
    roles: [role1,role6]
  - username: root
    password: 23456
    roles: [role1,role4]
  - username: tom
    password: 32113
    roles: [role3]

```

:::warning

Live reloading of this file is currently not supported.

## Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

DB2Rest supports RBAC control out of the box when security is enabled. It will first check the users to match the user and password.
In case of a successful match, it will go ahead and check the resource being requested is in the `resourceRoles`. If a matching resource is found,
it will verify that the user's roles matches the allowed role list for the resource. Then the gate is opened to access the database resource.

Each request must provide the username and password in a *base64* encoded format as part of the `Authorization` header.
