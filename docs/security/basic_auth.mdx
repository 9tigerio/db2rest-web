# Basic Auth


DBRest supports basic auth to protect the API end points. By default, auth is disabled in DB2Rest. It can be enabled by setting the
`ENABLE_AUTH` environment variable to `true`.

:::info

If the parameter - `ENABLE_AUTH` is set to `true`, then authentication is enabled.

## Auth Data Source

The security data source is kept separate from application properties. Currently only file based datasource is supported.
The absolute path of the data file can be specified with the `AUTH_DATA_SOURCE` configuration parameter.
An example to set auth data source is shown below:

```
$ export AUTH_DATA_SOURCE = `file://${user.home}/git/db2rest/auth/auth-sample.yml`
```


## Error handling

If delete operation is attempted when `ALLOW_SAFE_DELETE` is set to `false`, it will result in error as shown below in the
response payload.

```
{
"type": "https://github.com/kdhrubo/db2rest/delete-bad-request",
"title": "Delete Operation Not allowed",
"status": 400,
"detail": "Invalid delete operation , safe set to true",
"instance": "/film",
"errorCategory": "Delete-Error",
"timestamp": "2023-12-26T08:19:43.232283Z"
}
```

TODO - add more error scenarios.
