# Introduction to Named SQL

With named SQL it is possible to write SQL queries in an external file and turn it into DATA API endpoints.


## Named SQL Endpoint

The API endpoint for calling Named SQL is `/{dbId}/sql/{filename}`, where `dbId` is the configured database identifier and `filename`
is the name of the filename containing the sql, like 'select_some_employees' where the filename with extension is: select_some_employees.sql

## Template files location and configuration

The template files (*.sql) can be stored in a relative directory, created in a sub directory of the db2rest root or startup directory.
Or an absolute directory anywhere on the file system. This directory has to be configured in the application.yaml file:
```yaml

db2rest:
  templates: namedsqltemplates
  
```

## Example


Consider the Named SQL `select_some_employees.sql` below:

```sql

select * from employees where employee_id > {{start}} and employee_id < {{end}}

```

The `select_some_employees` named sql can be invoked using the following endpoint.


import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="cURL" label="cURL" default>
        ```bash

        curl 'http://localhost:8080/v1/rdbms/pgsqldb/sql/select_some_employees/3/5' -i -X GET \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8' \
		-H 'paths:start,end' \
        -H 'Accept: application/json' \
        

        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="httpie" label="HTTPie">
        ```bash

        http GET 'http://localhost:8080/v1/rdbms/sql/select_some_employees/3/5' \
        'Content-Type:application/json;charset=UTF-8' \
		'paths:start,end' \
        'Accept:application/json'

        ```
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>


The returned employee is shown below:


```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 19

{
    "employee_id":4,
    "name": "Bill Jackson"
}
```
