# Restrict Schemas

By default, DB2Rest will load all metadata from all schemas. In case the database under consideration has many schemas with
many tables, then loading the metadata will slow down startup times. Also, it may not be feasible to expose tables from all
schemas as REST API. In order to handle such cases, DB2Rest allows exposing tables from a select set of schemas.


In order to specify only a subset of schemas use the configuration parameter `INCLUDED_SCHEMAS`. The list can be specified as a comma separated string as shown below

```bash

 export INCLUDED_SCHEMAS=public,hrms

```

In the example above only tables from the two schemas namely `public` and `hrms` will be accessible as REST APIs.
