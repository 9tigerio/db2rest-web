# Getting Started with Reading Data from Table

The easiest way to retrieve data from a table is to send a GET request with the table name.



import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="cURL" label="cURL" default>
        ```bash
        curl --request GET \
        --url http://localhost:8080/film \
        --header 'Accept-Profile: ' \
        --header 'User-Agent: insomnia/8.4.5'

        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="httpie" label="HTTPie">
        ```bash
        http GET http://localhost:8080/film \
        Accept-Profile:'' \
        User-Agent:insomnia/8.4.5
        ```
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

DB2Rest will respond with HTTP status code 200 and return a list of results.

This query will:
    - fetch all the rows from the table.
    - it will include all the columns from the table.

This is not ideal, if the table has many records as it will result in a [full table scan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_table_scan) and lot of data transported over
the network. It may also result in time-outs. DB2Rest can solve these problems by:

1. **Vertical filtering** - Allowing specifying the names of the columns that should be included in the result-set.
2. **Horizontal filtering** - Apply filtering criteria on the table records to retrieves only the matching records.
3. **Pagination** - Retrieve only a subset of the table records that match the horizontal filtering. For example,
if the horizontal filters match 35 records and requested page size is 10, then this means 4 pages of records - where first
three pages contain 10 records and the last one has 5 records. However, this will also result in 4 different requests.

The next sections will discuss filtering in greater detail.
