# Getting Started with Reading Data from Database Table

The easiest way to retrieve data from a table is to send a GET request with the table name.



:::info[Table Access Rules]

    - If the database user/role has permission to access the table then it will be considered for query.
    - In case the user has access to multiple schema, the table name must be unique if DB2Rest is not running in multi-tenant mode.

:::


import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="cURL" label="cURL" default>
        ```bash
        curl --request GET \
        --url http://localhost:8080/v1/rdbms/pgdb/film \
        --header 'Accept-Profile: ' \
        --header 'User-Agent: insomnia/8.4.5'

        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="httpie" label="HTTPie">
        ```bash
        http GET http://localhost:8080/v1/rdbms/pgdb/film \
        Accept-Profile:'' \
        User-Agent:insomnia/8.4.5
        ```
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

DB2Rest will respond with HTTP status code 200 and return a list of results.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json

    ....
]

```

This query will:
    - fetch all the rows from the table.
    - it will include all the columns from the table.

This is not ideal, if the table has many records as it will result in a [full table scan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_table_scan) and lot of data transported over
the network. It may also result in time-outs. DB2Rest can solve these problems by:

1. **Column filtering** - Allowing specifying the names of the columns that should be included in the result-set.
2. **Row filtering** - Apply filtering criteria on the table rows to retrieves only the matching rows.
3. **Pagination** - Retrieve only a subset of the table rows that match the horizontal filtering. For example,
if the row filters match 35 rows and requested page size is 10, then this means 4 pages of rows - where first
three pages contain 10 rows and the last one has 5 row. In order to browse through these rows, 4 separate requests have to be made.

The next sections will discuss filtering in greater detail.
