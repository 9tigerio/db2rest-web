# Handle large result-sets with Pagination

Sometimes the result of a query execution can fetch many records. It is inefficient to fetch a large number of rows.
It can generate a lot of network traffic as the consuming application may not require all the records.
DB2Rest implements offset pagination to support limiting the results of a query.

## The LIMIT clause

The simplest and most straightforward way to limit the number of rows returned by a query is to use the `LIMIT` clause.
The `LIMIT` clause allows you to specify the maximum number of rows that you want returned from your query.

Here’s an example of how to use the `LIMIT` clause:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="cURL" label="cURL" default>
        ```bash
        curl --request GET \
        --url 'http://localhost:8080/v1/rdbms/db/film?limit=5&fields=title,release_year:year' \
        --header 'User-Agent: insomnia/8.6.1'

        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="httpie" label="HTTPie">
        ```bash
        http GET 'http://localhost:8080/v1/rdbms/db/film?limit=5&fields=title,release_year:year' \
        User-Agent:insomnia/8.6.1
        ```
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

This query will return the first 5 rows from the `film` table.
Note that the order in which the rows are returned depends on the order specified in the `SORT` clause (if one is present).
If no `SORT` clause is present, the order of the rows is undefined.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

[
	{
		"title": "ACADEMY DINOSAUR",
		"year": 2006
	},
	{
		"title": "ACE GOLDFINGER",
		"year": 2006
	},
	{
		"title": "ADAPTATION HOLES",
		"year": 2006
	},
	{
		"title": "AFFAIR PREJUDICE",
		"year": 2006
	},
    {
		"title": "AFFAIR PREJUDICE 2",
		"year": 2010
	}
]

```


## Using LIMIT With OFFSET

In addition to the `LIMIT` clause, the `OFFSET` clause can be used to skip a specified number of rows before starting to return results.
Here’s an example of how to use the `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clause:



<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="cURL" label="cURL" default>
        ```bash
        curl --request GET \
        --url 'http://localhost:8080/v1/rdbms/db/film?offset=20&limit=10' \
        --header 'User-Agent: insomnia/8.6.1'

        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="httpie" label="HTTPie">
        ```bash
        http GET 'http://localhost:8080/v1/rdbms/db/film?offset=20&limit=10' \
        User-Agent:insomnia/8.6.1
        ```
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

The query above will skip 20 rows and then fetch the next 10 rows.

:::warning

If `offset` is specified without `limit`, then `offset` will be ignored.

## The Global LIMIT

By default, DB2Rest puts a limit of 100 for read queries. The value can be changed by setting the value of the `DEFAULT_FETCH_LIMIT` configuration parameter.

Performance can vary depending on the amount of RAM given to the Java Heap (`-Xmx` Java Option) for DB2Rest, as well as the number of fields requested, their content length, or even database query performance and indexing itself, and thus the `DEFAULT_FETCH_LIMIT` or `&limit` parameter can be adjusted and even increased significantly given adequate resources.  DB2Rest has been tested using 1000's of rows as the limit, even with only 2GB of RAM `-Xmx 2G` and simple records being returned from a PostgreSQL query and can still perform extremely fast for most applications.
