# How to add column alias?

In the previous section of vertical filtering,
the query below returns `title`,`description` and `release_year` columns. It is common in JSON payloads, to
return these attributes in camel notation instead of underscore. This makes the column names more readable.

DB2Rest makes this possible with use of column alias syntax as shown below.

:::info

Column alias can be specified with a `:` followed by column alias string

`column_name:column_alias_string`

e.x - `release-year:releaseYear`

:::



import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="cURL" label="cURL" default>
        ```bash
        curl --request GET \
        --url 'http://localhost:8080/film?fields=title,description,release_year:releaseYear' \
        --header 'User-Agent: insomnia/8.6.1'

        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="httpie" label="HTTPie">
        ```bash
        http GET 'http://localhost:8080/film?fields=title,description,release_year:releaseYear' \
        Accept-Profile:sakila \
        User-Agent:insomnia/8.4.5
        ```
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>


This will retrieve the following result with the 3rd column or field name as `releaseYear`.
